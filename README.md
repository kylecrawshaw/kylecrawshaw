# About:
Currently working as the DevOps Lead at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston on Project Hamilton. My work is focused on researching the infrastructure required to run a multi-region distributed CBDC. Built a fully automated testing system running in Kubernetes using ArgoCD, Argo Workflows, and custom API services spread across multiple clusters with hundreds of nodes.

## Currently Learning
- Go: learning to build Kubernetes Operators in Go
- Rust: fascinated by development efficiencies and guardrails provided the Rust compiler

## Languages:
- Python: highest level of proficiency and have built multiple critical path applications using FastAPI, Typer, Flask, and Django.
- Swift: built a MacOS desktop application to manage Imagr manifests.
